**Additional comments**
- The map is composed by diferent zones where the game conditions change. In some of those, the camera stops and the player can’t go to the next zone until all enemies are eliminated. However, since in this version these are still not implemented, press C to continue moving. 
If arrow keys are pressed, the camera will move and the mechanics of the game (camera limits mostly) wont work.
